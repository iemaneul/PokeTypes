PokeTypes

Sometimes, playing Pokémon, we are faced with the dilemma: will my attack on that Pokémon work? Will I do a lot of damage?

For this, there are tables on the internet, showing which moves are weak, strong or don't work on certain Pokémon.
Therefore, while studying React Native, I developed a tool that shows these types' weaknesses, resistances and strengths, against other types.
However, of course, with a cleaner screen, without much information when you look at it, with a nice, robust design and paying attention to what really matters. In this case, the effectiveness of each type of blow on each type of Pokémon.

It is worth remembering that there is a hill below with immunities. I preferred to separate them, as the layout could be very cluttered.

I used this Deviantart to  get all the assets: https://www.deviantart.com/jormxdos/gallery/88740781/pokemon-type-symbols-paldea
